# PitWall-AI 🏎️ 🤖

This repository contains the source code for an AI-powered Formula 1 chatbot. This project leverages the FastF1 library to fetch and analyze telemetry data and the Google Gemini API to interpret natural language queries and provide human-like analysis of driver and car performance.

The goal is to create a tool that allows users to ask complex questions about F1 sessions—like "Compare Hamilton's and Verstappen's throttle input through the final sector at Silverstone"—and receive a rich response containing visualizations and expert-level commentary.

## Key Features

-Natural Language Interface: Ask questions in plain English, and the AI will understand your intent.
-Deep Telemetry Analysis: Access and process detailed data including speed, throttle, brake, steering, gear, and GPS.
-Dynamic Visualizations: Automatically generate plots, track maps, and comparison charts using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
-AI-Powered Insights: Use Gemini to synthesize data and generate insightful, human-like explanations of performance, strategy, and race events.
-Comparative Analysis: Easily compare multiple drivers, laps, or stints within a session or across different races.
